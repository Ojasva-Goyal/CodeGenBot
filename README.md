## Project Overview

This project was originally built as part of an **Intro to LLM** lab assignment. It uses the **LangChain Google Generative AI** integration (`langchain_google_genai`) to interact with Gemini-1.5-flash. The Streamlit app provides a user-friendly interface for prompt engineering, code generation, and iterative refinement.

## Features

1. **Multi-step Prompting Flow**  
   - Users provide an initial coding request, choose a prompting technique, see multiple redrafted prompts, and pick one to finalize the solution.

2. **Dark/Light Mode**  
   - A ‚Äúüåô Dark Mode‚Äù toggle in the top-right corner lets you switch between dark mode (black background with white text) and light mode.

3. **Technique Descriptions**  
   - An expandable section explains each prompting technique in plain language, making it accessible to non-technical users.

4. **Follow-up Conversation**  
   - After the initial solution is generated, users can ask further questions or refine their requests. All responses are returned as valid JSON with `"code"` and `"explanation"`.

5. **Strict JSON Enforcement**  
   - Every response from CodeGenBot is enforced to follow a strict JSON structure for consistency and ease of parsing.
